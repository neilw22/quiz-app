Quiz App Notes

On click on specific div - 

	- Show correct answer information (diplay in a hidden floating box)
	- Hide everything else
	- Provide a next question option
	- Display if you answered correctly or not
	- Append the score of your answers somewhere on the page
	- Get content into an array that changes

Strategy 
	- Start by experimenting with showing and hiding specific text in boxes
	- Review the object oriented JS
	- Style and add images at the very end

First test

	- onclick answer option 1 - change "question" to "answer" using "addclass"

Create object
	- properties of the question object - question content, answers
	- constructor function

Arrays - use array[#] to access values of the array
